## Usage
### Step 0: Fork This GitHub Repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikami520/CIS2-EustachianTube.git
```

### Step 1: Set Up Two Environments Using requirements.txt Files (virtual environment is recommended)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Preprocess Datasets
#### Step 2.1: Register Data to Template
Activate scripting environment
```bash
cd <path to repo>/preprocessing
```
Register data to template (can be used for multiple segmentations propagation)
```bash
python3 registration.py -bp <full path of base dir> -ip <relative path to nifti images dir> -sp <relative path to segmentations dir> 
```
If you want to make sure correspondence of the name and value of segmentations, you can add the following commands after above command
```bash
-sl LabelValue1 LabelName1 LabelValue2 LabelName2 LabelValue3 LabelName3 ...
```
For example, if I have two labels for maxillary sinus named L-MS and R-MS
```bash
python3 registration.py -bp /Users/mikamixiao/Desktop -ip images -sp labels -sl 1 L-MS 2 R-MS
```
Final output of registered images and segmentations will be saved in 
```text
imagesRS/ && labelsRS/
```
#### Step 2.2: Create Datasplit for Training/Testing. Validation will be chosen automatically by nnUNet (filename format should be taskname_xxx.nii.gz)
```bash
python3 split_data.py -bp <full path of base dir> -ip <relative path to nifti images dir (imagesRS)> -sp <relative path to nifti segmentations dir (labelsRS)> -sl <a list of label name and corresponding label value> -ti <task id for nnUNet preprocessing> -tn <name of task>
```
For example
```bash
python3 split_data.py -bp /Users/mikamixiao/Desktop -ip imagesRS -sp labelsRS -sl 1 L-MS 2 R-MS -ti 001 -tn Sinus
```

### Step 3: Setup Bashrc

Edit your `~/.bashrc` file with `gedit ~/.bashrc` or `nano ~/.bashrc`. At the end of the file, add the following lines:

```bash
export nnUNet_raw_data_base="<ABSOLUTE PATH TO BASE_DIR>/nnUnet/nnUNet_raw_data_base" 
export nnUNet_preprocessed="<ABSOLUTE PATH TO BASE_DIR>/nnUNet_preprocessed" 
export RESULTS_FOLDER="<ABSOLUTE PATH TO BASE_DIR>/nnUnet/nnUNet_trained_models"
```

After updating this you will need to source your `~/.bashrc` file.

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

This will deactivate your current conda environment.

### Step 4: Verify and Preprocess Data
Activate nnUNet environment
```bash
source <virtual environment folder name>/bin/activate
```
Run nnUNet preprocessing script.
```bash
nnUNet_plan_and_preprocess -t <task_id> --verify_dataset_integrity
```
Potential Error: You may need to edit the dataset.json file so that the labels are sequential. If you have at least 10 labels, then labels `10, 11, 12,...` will be arranged before labels `2, 3, 4, ...`. Doing this in a text editor is completely fine!

### Step 5: Begin Training

```bash
nnUNet_train 3d_fullres nnUNetTrainerV2 Task<task_num>_TemporalBone Y --npz
```

`Y` refers to the number of folds for cross-validation. If `Y` is set to `all` then all of the data will be used for training. If you want to try 5-folds cross validation, you should define Y as `0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ` for five times.

`--npz` makes the models save the softmax outputs (uncompressed, large files) during the final validation. It should only be used if you are training multiple configurations, which requires `nnUNet_find_best_configuration` to find the best model. We omit this by default.

### Step 6: Run Inference

`nnUNet_find_best_configuration` will print a string to the terminal with the inference commands you need to use.
The easiest way to run inference is to simply use these commands.

If you wish to manually specify the configuration(s) used for inference, use the following commands:

For each of the desired configurations, run:

```bash
nnUNet_predict -i INPUT_FOLDER -o OUTPUT_FOLDER -t TASK_NAME_OR_ID -m CONFIGURATION --save_npz
```

Only specify `--save_npz` if you intend to use ensembling. `--save_npz` will make the command save the softmax
probabilities alongside of the predicted segmentation masks requiring a lot of disk space.

Please select a separate `OUTPUT_FOLDER` for each configuration!

If you wish to run ensembling, you can ensemble the predictions from several configurations with the following command:

```bash
nnUNet_ensemble -f FOLDER1 FOLDER2 ... -o OUTPUT_FOLDER -pp POSTPROCESSING_FILE
```

You can specify an arbitrary number of folders, but remember that each folder needs to contain npz files that were
generated by `nnUNet_predict`. For ensembling you can also specify a file that tells the command how to postprocess.
These files are created when running `nnUNet_find_best_configuration` and are located in the respective trained model directory `(RESULTS_FOLDER/nnUNet/CONFIGURATION/TaskXXX_MYTASK/TRAINER_CLASS_NAME__PLANS_FILE_IDENTIFIER/postprocessing.json or RESULTS_FOLDER/nnUNet/ensembles/TaskXXX_MYTASK/ensemble_X__Y__Z--X__Y__Z/postprocessing.json)`. You can also choose to not provide a file (simply omit -pp) and nnU-Net will not run postprocessing.

Note that per default, inference will be done with all available folds. We very strongly recommend you use all 5 folds.
Thus, all 5 folds must have been trained prior to running inference. The list of available folds nnU-Net found will be
printed at the start of the inference.

### Step 7: Evaluate Inference
#### To compute the dice score, average hausdorff distance and weighted hausdorff distance:
```bash
cd <path to repo>/metrics
```
Run the metrics.py to output a CSV file that contain the dice score and hausdorff distance for each segmentation:
```bash
python3 metrics.py -bp <full path of base dir> -gp <relative path of ground truth dir> -pp <relative path of predicted segmentations dir> -sp <save dir> -vt <Validation type: 'dsc', 'ahd', 'whd'>
```
Users can choose any combinations of evaluation types among these three choices. 
```text
dsc: Dice Score
ahd: Average Hausdorff Distance
whd: Weighted Hausdorff Distance
``` 
If choosing ```whd``` and you do not have a probability map, you can use ```get_probability_map.py```to obtain one. Here is the way to use:
```bash
python3 get_probability_map.py -bp <full path of base dir> -pp <relative path of predicted segmentations dir> -rr <ratio to split skeleton> -ps <probability sequences>
```
Currently, we split the skeleton alongside the x axis and from ear end to nasal. Please make sure the probability sequences are matched to the splitted regions. The output probability map which is a text file will be stored in ```output/```under the ```base directory```. Once obtaining the probability map, you can import your customized probability map by adding following command when using ```metrics.py```:
```bash
-pm <relative path of probability map>
```
#### To draw the heat map to see the failing part of prediction:
```bash
python3 distanceVertex2Mesh.py -bp <full path of base dir> -gp <relative path of ground truth dir> -pp <relative path of predicted segmentations dir>
```
Once you get the closest distance (save in ```output/``` under ```base directory```) from prediction to ground truth, you can easily draw the heat map and use the color bar to show the change of differences (```ParaView``` is recommended)
